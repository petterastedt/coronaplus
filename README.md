# ðŸ˜· Corona+ (corona postitive)

Played around with the [NovelCovid Api](https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API) and created a website that displays statistics about the spread of the corona virus with the posibillity filter on some more positive statistics such as: amount of recovered patients and mild (non-critical) cases. Death counts are hidden by default but can be shown with a checkbox filter.

Created using React and [NovelCovid Api](https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API)
